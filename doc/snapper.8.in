.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP
Snapper is a command\-line program for filesystem snapshot management. It can
create, delete and compare snapshots and undo changes done between snapshots.
.LP
Snapper never modifies the content of snapshots. Thus snapper creates
read-only snapshots if supported by the kernel. Supported filesystems are
btrfs and ext4 as well as snapshots of LVM logical volumes with
thin-provisioning. Some filesystems might not be supported depending on your
installation.

.SH CONCEPTS

.SS Configurations
.LP
For each filesystem or subvolume that should be snapshotted by snapper a
configuration file is required. The complete setup can be done with the
create-config command.

.SS Snapshots
.LP
Snapper distinguishes three types of snapshots.
.LP
\fBpre\fR - Pre snapshots should always have a corresponding post
snapshot. The intention of pre/post shotshot pairs is to snapshot the
filesystem before and after a modification.
.LP
\fBpost\fR - See pre type.
.LP
\fBsingle\fR - These snapshots have no special relationship to other
snapshots.
.LP
Note that filesystem\-wise all three types are the same.

.SS Snapshot Description und Userdata
.LP
With each snapshot a description and some userdata can be associated. The
description is a string. The userdata is a list of key-value pairs where the
keys and values are strings.

.SS Automatic Snapshot Creation
Next to manual snapshot creation snapshots are also created automatically.
.LP
\fBcron\-job\fR - A cron\-job creates hourly snapshots.
.LP
\fBcertain programs\fR - Certain programs like YaST and zypper create pre/post
snapshot pairs when modifying the system.

.SS Cleanup Algorithms
.LP
Snapper provides several algorithms to cleanup old snapshots. The algorithms
are executed in a daily cron\-job. This can be configured in the corresponding
configurations files along with parameters for every algorithm.
.LP
\fBnumber\fR - Deletes old snapshots when a certain number of snapshots is
reached.
.LP
\fBtimeline\fR - Deletes old snapshots but keeps a number of hourly, daily,
monthly and yearly snapshots.
.LP
\fBempty\-pre\-post\fR - Deletes pre/post snapshot pairs with empty diffs.

.SH "GLOBAL OPTIONS"

.TP
.I \-q, \-\-quiet
Suppress normal output. Error messages will still be printed, though.
.TP
.I \-v, \-\-verbose
Increase verbosity.
.TP
.I \-t, \-\-table\-style
Specifies table style. Table style is identified by an integer number.
.TP
.I \-c, \-\-config <name>
Use specified configuration instead of the default configuration. The default
configuration is named "root".
.TP
.I \-\-version
Print version and exit.

.SH "COMMANDS"
.LP
snapper provides a number of \fBcommands\fR. Each command accepts the options
listed in the GLOBAL OPTIONS section. These options must be specified
\fIbefore\fR the command name. In addition, many commands have specific
options, which are listed in this section. These command-specific options must
be specified \fIafter\fR the name of the command and \fIbefore\fR any of the
command arguments.

.TP
.B help
Show short help text.

.TP
.B list-configs
List available configurations.

.TP
.B create-config [options] <subvolume>
Create a new configuration for a filesystem or subvolume. For this command you
will likely need the global option \fI--config\fR, see \fBGLOBAL OPTIONS\fR and
\fBCONCEPTS\fR.
.TP
\fI\-f, \-\-fstype\fR <fstype>
Manually set filesystem type. Supported values are btrfs, ext4 and lvm. For
lvm snapper uses LVM thin-provisioned snapshots. The filesystem type on top of
LVM must be provided in parentheses, e.g. lvm(xfs).

Without this option snapper tries to detect the filesystem.

.TP
\fI\-t, \-\-template\fR <name>
Name of template for the new configuration file.

.TP
.B delete-config
Delete a configuration for a filesystem or subvolume. For this command you
will likely need to global option \fI--config\fR, see \fBGLOBAL OPTIONS\fR and
\fBCONCEPTS\fR.

.TP
.B list [options]
List snapshots.
.TP
\fI\-t, \-\-type\fR <type>
Selects type of snapshots to list. Possible values are all, single and pre-post.

.TP
.B create [options]
Create a new snapshot.
.TP
\fI\-t, \-\-type\fR <type>
Specifies the type of the new snapshot. Possible values are single, pre and post.
.TP
\fI\-\-pre\-number\fR <number>
For post snapshots the number of the pre snapshot must be provided.
.TP
\fI\-p, \-\-print\-number\fR
Print number of the created snapshot.
.TP
\fI\-d, \-\-description\fR <description>
Description for the snapshot.
.TP
\fI\-c, \-\-cleanup\-algorithm\fR <cleanup-algorithm>
Set the cleanup-algorithm for the snapshot.
.TP
\fI\-u, \-\-userdata\fR <userdata>
Set userdata for the snapshot. The key-value pairs must be seperated by comma
and the key and value must be seperated by an equal sign,
e.g. requestid=42,user=arthur.
.TP
\fI\-\-command\fR <command>
Create a pre and post snapshot and run command in between.

.TP
.B modify [options] <number>
Modify a snapshot.
.TP
\fI\-d, \-\-description\fR <description>
New description for snapshot.
.TP
\fI\-c, \-\-cleanup\-algorithm\fR <cleanup-algorithm>
Set the cleanup-algorithm for the snapshot.
.TP
\fI\-u, \-\-userdata\fR <userdata>
Set userdata for the snapshot. The key-value pairs must be seperated by comma
and the key and value must be seperated by an equal sign,
e.g. requestid=42,user=arthur.

.TP
.B delete <number> | <number1>-<number2>
Delete a snapshot or a range of snapshots.

.TP
.B mount <number>
Mount a snapshot. Not required for all filesystem types.

.TP
.B umount <number>
Unmount a snapshot. Not required for all filesystem types.

.TP
.B status [options] <number1>..<number2>

directories that have been created, modified or deleted in the time between
the two snapshots have been made.
.TP
\fI\-o, \-\-output\fR <file>
Write output to file <file>.

.TP
.B diff [options] <number1>..<number2> [files]
Compare the snapshots number1 and number2. This will show a diff of the
content of files and directories that have been created, modified or deleted
in the time between the two snapshots have been made.

.TP
.B undochange [options] <number1>..<number2> [files]
Undo changes done between snapshot number1 and number2.
.TP
\fI\-i, \-\-input\fR <file>
Read files for which to undo changes from file <file>.

.TP
.B cleanup <cleanup-algorithm>
Run the cleanup algorithm <cleanup-algorithm>. Currently implemented cleanup
algorithms are number, timeline and empty-pre-post.

.SH "PERMISSIONS"
.LP
Non-root users can be allowed to use a configuration by setting ALLOW_USERS or
ALLOW_GROUPS in the config file. For all operations to work the user must also
be able to read and access the .snapshots directory inside the
subvolume. The .snapshots directory must be owned by root and must not be
writable by anybody else.

.SH "FILES"
.TP
.B /etc/sysconfig/snapper
Global configuration file.
.TP
.B /etc/snapper/configs
Directory containing configuration files.
.TP
.B /etc/snapper/config-templates
Directory containing configuration templates.
.TP
.B /etc/snapper/filters
Directory containing filter files.
.TP
.B /var/log/snapper.log
Logfile. Please include this file in bug reports.

.SH "NOTES"
.LP
There is no mechanism to ensure consistency of the files while a snapshot it
made. E.g. the files of a database can be inconsistence while the database is
running.
.LP
Consistency after undochange is not guaranteed. E.g. when the creation of a
user is undone there might still exist files from that user.
